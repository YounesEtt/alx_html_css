This project is for applying advanced structures to html.  

## HTML Content

The HTML file includes:

- Semantic elements such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`
- Block-level elements like `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>`
- Images using the `<img>` tag
- Buttons for user interaction using the `<button>` element

All content is structured to ensure clarity, accessibility, and maintainability.
